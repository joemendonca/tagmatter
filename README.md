# Tagmatter

Automatically formats inline #tags into clean YAML frontmatter.

## What it does

Write tags anywhere in your document using the standard #tag syntax, and Tagmatter will automatically format them into your frontmatter. For anyone who prefers using tags throughout their writing, or simply doesnâ€™t want to fuss with YAML, Tagmatter keeps your metadata clean by collecting every inline tag and properly formatting it in frontmatter automatically.

**Example:**

You write:
```
"#Luke, you can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is your destiny. Join me, and #together, we can rule the #galaxy as father and son."
```

Tagmatter automatically creates/updates:
```yaml
---
tags:
  - galaxy
  - luke
  - together
---
```

## Features

- **Automatic sync**: Tags are synced to frontmatter when you switch away from the file
- **Smart punctuation handling**: `#tag.` correctly becomes `tag`
- **Lowercase normalization**: Optionally convert tags to lowercase (enabled by default)
- **Automatic cleanup**: Remove tags from frontmatter when you delete them from the document
- **Deduplication**: No duplicate tags in your frontmatter
- **Manual command**: Force sync anytime with the command palette
- **Configurable**: Customize behavior in settings

## Settings

- **Auto-sync tags**: Toggle automatic syncing on file save (default: enabled)
- **Lowercase tags**: Convert all tags to lowercase, e.g., `#Tag` becomes `tag` (default: enabled)
